# Computer Virus vs. Biological Virus Model

## Overview
This project aims to simulate the spread of a computer virus in a network using epidemiological models traditionally used in biology, such as the SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model. By drawing parallels between the spread of biological viruses and computer viruses, the project seeks to identify similarities and differences and suggest improvements to cybersecurity strategies.

## Objectives
- Implement an SIR model to simulate the spread of a computer virus across a network.
- Compare the results to the spread of a biological virus in a population.
- Analyze the effectiveness of different parameters (e.g., infection rate, recovery rate) in controlling the spread of the virus.
